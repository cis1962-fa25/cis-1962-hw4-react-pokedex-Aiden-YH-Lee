# Homework 4 AI Synthesis Activity

Only complete one of the assignments below! You can delete the other assignment in this document once you've made your choice.

## Activity: You used AI

### Part 1

Look at notes.md

### Part 2

I used AI to fix some CSS, ask for advice on general architecture and how components should interact, debugging, and guidance on implementation. I also used it to ask any conceptual questions.

### Part 3

I still think AI is usually better than me so it's a good resource to ask questions and learn. I don't think it hallucinates that much when I try breaking down what I want into small parts and ask incrementally.

### Part 4

I learned a lot about actually using useState and useEffect. It was also interesting to see how components interact with each other and how to design modular code for react.

## Activity B: You did NOT use AI

### Part 1

> Explain some improvement you want to make within your code. Perhaps you have a code block that could be more concise, or a part of your code could be improved with a library or be performed with a more efficient algorithm.

### Part 2

> Ask AI how to improve your code, by picking a part of your program you are interested in improving and asking something along the lines of "how can I improve this code?" This does not have to be verbatim; you could ask more specific questions for improvement, like "what JavaScript libraries could improve the efficiency of my code?" Screenshot or link the response.

### Part 3

> Evaluate the response the AI generates. You may need to do some research to do this evaluation, to see if the syntax generates correctly or if any libraries the AI suggests are appropriate for the current task. Report on whether the AI's solution fits within your project, or if it would need modifications to work properly.

**_ You do NOT need to use the AI suggestion within your final submission, if your code already works properly. If the scope of your inquiry in this activity leads you to replace parts of your code, switch to the other version of this activity instead. _**
